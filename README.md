### Key Modifications

- **User-Agent Header for RPC Requests**: Added support for setting a custom `User-Agent` header in all RPC requests. This modification allows requests to comply with WAF (Web Application Firewall) requirements that may require a specific `User-Agent` value.

  The `User-Agent` can be set dynamically via environment variables or defaults to a custom value. Hereâ€™s an example:

  ```javascript
  import { Client } from "./path-to-client";

  // Example setup with dynamic User-Agent
  const client = new Client("https://rpc-url", {
      userAgent: process.env.USER_AGENT || "YourCustomUserAgent/1.0.0"
  });
